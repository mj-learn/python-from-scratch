# Instructions
#
# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that
# 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
# Given a random height and width of wall,
# calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
#
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) รท coverage per can.
#
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
#
# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
#                = 1.6
#
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint,
# the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
#
# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters
# must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
#
# Example Input
# 3
# 9
#
# Example Output
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.
